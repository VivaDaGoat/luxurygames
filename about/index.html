  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hello. Welcome to one of my greatest creations. So luxury proxy broke. That's my bad, I published it before it was fully ready. Right now we just have a couple games. However, they all save, and we are adding new games every day. It's not just bad games like we have on google sites, I'm talking about heavy hitters like undertale and btd6. Now, just be patient and wait until after winter break. Email me your name + 2026 and ill give u the password for luxury proxy.</p>
